# simple-QuizApp
Our quiz app contains a total of three-screen, the welcome screen where a user submits their name than the main screen called the questions screen. 
Each question has 4 options once the user click on the option if the answer is correct then it turns green otherwise red. 
At the end score screen where you can check your score.

This Flutter project demonstrates the development of a simple quiz app that allows users to answer multiple-choice questions and receive instant feedback on their answers. 
The app is built using Flutter and utilizes state management techniques for a smooth user experience.

## Getting Started
You can find main code at 'lib/main.dart' set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Flutter and Dart should be installed on your machine.

## Features
- Display multiple-choice questions to users.
- Provide instant feedback on user-selected answers.
- Calculate and display the user's final score at the end.

## How It Works
1. The app uses state management techniques to manage the quiz data and user interactions.
2. Questions are stored in a data model with options and correct answers.
3. Users select their answers during 15 sec, and the app displays whether the answer is correct or not.
4. At the end of the quiz, the user's score is calculated and displayed.
